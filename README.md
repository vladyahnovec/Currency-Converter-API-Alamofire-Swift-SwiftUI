Currency Exchange App. The API and Alamofire framework are used. 
Application logic: user selects a currency, then user selects the amount to be exchanged and the currency to be exchanged for.
The system detects the country outputs a flag and outputs the final amount. There is also a button, when you press which field values are reversed 
(i.e. the currency to be exchanged for the one to which it is exchanged).
